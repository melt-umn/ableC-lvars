     + Can get rid of freeLattice()
     + Way to wrap everything that isn't top in value()?
     + Need to fix lattice constructor to not use top as base type
     + Need to fix newLatticeNoFree to get correct type
     + create make_lvar (maybe with default show?)
     + Re-check valgrind
     + make isTop function that users can access
     + don't need to differentiate with pos int
     + fix segfault in colors.xc
